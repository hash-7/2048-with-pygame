# 2048-with-pygame
An implementation of the game 2048 with pygame library

Check out my simpler version of 2048, also implemented with python, but not the pygame library. 

##Rules

There will be 16 empty slots on a 4x4 board.

The player will start with two numbers that are either two or four, on two random slots on the board.

The player uses <kbd>up</kbd>, <kbd>down</kbd>, <kbd>left</kbd>, <kbd>right</kbd> arrow key to move the numbers.

If the player gets the number "2048" on the board, he/she wins.

The player looses if all the slots are filled in and he/she cannot make any move at all.
